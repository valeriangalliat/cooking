## Ingredients

For 4 people.

* 1 kg potatoes
* 200 g lardons fum√©s
* 200 g chopped onions
* 1 reblochon
* 1 garlic clove
* Cream

## Preparation

Chop potatoes, cut them in dice or slices. If doing slices, might be a
good idea to precook them in water before going the next step.

Oil a pan and fry the onions. When done, add the potatoes and fry on all
sides.

When potatoes are done, add lardons and cook them.

Preheat the oven at 200 ¬∞C. Brush the oven plate with the garlic clove.
Put a layer of potatoes and lardons preparation, then a layer of sliced
reblochon, then another layer of potatoes and lardons, then cover with
the rest of the reblochon. Add cream between the layers at any time.

Cook for about 20 minutes.
