# ðŸ¥© Steak risotto

## Ingredients

* Steak
* Risotto rice
* Cream
* Couscous spices

## Preparation

Start to cook steak in butter, add rice and fry the rice in the butter
and steak juice.

When rice gets transparent, add lots of cream and some couscous spice,
and cook the rice in the cream.

Add a bunch of water along the way to cook the rice fully. It's done
when the rice absorbed all the water and only a creamy sauce remains.

## Thoughts

The issue is the steak ends up overcooked as the rice needs quite some
time to absorb all the water, however the rice ends up being fucking
tasty from being cooked with the steak all the way, so the steak while
still good to eat, is not the best as it's too cooked, but it acted more
like a spice for the rice, like a condiment, rather than being a main
piece of the dish.

Maybe putting the steak later would help but I'm worried it would make
the rice less tasty. Probably removing the steak much earlier when it's
perfectly cooked would be better and wouldn't affect the rice as much,
but then the steak will be cold when the rice is done...
