# ðŸ¥¥ Coconut chicken almond couscous

## Ingredients

* Chicken breasts
* Coconut cream (I used "crema de coco" which is sweetened, but feel
  free to tweak with regular unsweetened cream)
* Dried raisins
* Almonds
* Onions
* Garlic powder
* Chili powder
* Lime juice
* Couscous
* [Swann's aunt's secret couscous spice mix](swann-couscous.md)
* Grated cheddar or parm (or both)
* 35% cream

## Preparation

Smash the almonds with a mortar and pestle.

Slice the chicken breasts in cubes and cook in a wok with olive oil.
When half cooked, throw in a bunch of coconut cream and let it finish
cooking in it.

At the same time, cook the onions in a pan with olive oil. When nearly
cooked, add the raisins, smashed almonds, garlic powder and chili powder
as well as some salt and pepper.

Cook the couscous by boiling 2 cups of water in a pot and adding 1 cup
of dry couscous. When it's done, add some salt and pepper as well as the
secret couscous spice mix and a bit of lime juice.

Add the contents of the onions pan to the chicken wok and mix together.

In another pot, put some coconut cream as well as some 35% cream to
taste, chili powder, salt and pepper to make the sauce.

Serve the couscous with the sauce on top, and put the chicken raisins
mixture on the side.
