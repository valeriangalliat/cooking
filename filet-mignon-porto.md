# üç∑ Mom's filet migon de porc sauce porto

For 4 people.

## Ingredients

* 1 filet mignon de porc (600 g)
* Chestnuts
* Rice

For the sauce:

* 300 ml port
* 150 g sugar
* 1 vanilla bean
* A pinch of cinnamon

## Preparation

Start the sauce first because it takes a while. Mix port and sugar with
the vanilla bean (or vanilla extract) and the cinnamon.

Make it boil, and reduce once it boils so it stays simmering. Keep
mixing until it becomes syrupy. Be careful to not overcook as it could
turn to caramel.

If it's too liquid, can add some corn starch.

Cut the pork in slices 1 cm thick.

In a pan, heat up oil and fry the pork slices 3 minutes each side. Salt,
pepper, and cover for another 3 minutes away from heat.

Cook chestnuts and rice and serve with it.
