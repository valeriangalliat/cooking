# ðŸ¥ž Alex's pancakes soliditÃ©

## Ingredients

* 1 banana
* 2 eggs
* Half a teaspoon of vanilla sugar
* Oatmeal

## Preparation

Smash the banana in its skin and juice it in a bowl.

Add the eggs and the vanilla sugar and blend it together.

Top up with a layer of oatmeal.

Cook like pancakes.

## Toppings

The solidity stack is made by stacking the pancakes and putting apple
slices between each layer, topped up with maple syrup.

## Val update

For extra solidity, add peanut butter and chocolate chips to the dough.

Another alternative I love is adding parm to the dough, and optionally
topping up with Nutella.
