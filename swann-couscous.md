# üêê Swann's couscous

## Ingredients

For many people.

* 2 onions
* 2 green peppers
* 2 red peppers
* 3 green chili peppers
* 6 medium potatoes
* 2 fenouils
* 2 poign√©es of little carrots
* 4 navets
* 5 small courgettes
* 1 can of pois chiches
* 4 cans (150 ml each) of concentr√© de tomate (might not need them all)
* 6 chicken legs (including 2 big ones)
* 2 lamb steak
* Secret spice mix from Swann's aunt
* Red chili powder
* 500 g semoule

## Preparation

Chop onions and put them with some olive oil in the couscoussier on high
heat.

Cut lamb steak into pieces (as big as you like, we did 2 pieces each
steak) and put in the couscoussier. Also add the chicken legs.

Put on medium heat and add 1 can of concentr√© de tomate, 1 table
spoon of secret spice mix and a little poign√©e of red chili powder.

Add some water if necessary so it doesn't stick.

Remove the fenouils out layer and chop it into 4 to 6 parts. Peel and
chop the navets, potatoes and carrots in chunks and add to the mix.

Add water to just cover the contents of the couscoussier.

Add more concentr√© de tomate if it's too liquid.

Add the can of pois chiches (drain the water first).

Add two phat table spoons of secret spice mix.

Add the peppers and chili peppers cut in strips.

Wait for the preparation to boil and add some salt.

At that point you want to start preparing the semoule, by putting it
into a saladier with 4 table spoons of olive oil, a phat table spoon of
secret spice mix, some salt and pepper. Mix by hand. Then add about a
pint of hot water from the robinet and keep mixing until you feel the
texture of the semoule transforming.

Add the courgettes in the couscoussier, and top up with water and extra
concentr√© de tomate as necessary.

Add some pepper to taste.

Then put the semoule in the top part of the couscoussier and steam it
until done.
