# üç∞ Royal

Based on Jenny's recipe.

This cake is my favorite cake, ever. Because it's the one my parents
used to get for my birthday ever since I can eat cake.

It's made of 3 layers. From bottom to top, a succ√®s aux amandes (the
crunchy part), a pralin√© feuillet√© (the thin crispy part in the middle)
and finally a chocolate mousse.

The Royal is a pretty complex and time consuming cake to make, that will
require you to wash a lot of dishes. If you want a cake that tastes 80%
as good for 20% of the work (and price), check out the [fondant au chocolat](fondant-au-chocolat.md)
recipe! But if you're not here to make tradeoffs, keep on reading.

## Ingredients

### Succ√®s aux amandes

* 60 g almond powder
* 130 g sugar
* 15 g flour
* 2 egg whites

### Pralin√© feuillet√©

* 200 g pralin√© amandes/noisettes
* 70 g white chocolate
* 120 g paillet√© feuilletine (or cr√™pes dentelles broken into small pieces)

### Chocolate mousse

* 6 eggs
* 120 g sugar
* 130 g cr√®me fra√Æche
* 350 g dark 70% chocolate
* 100 g butter

## Preparation

### Succ√®s aux amandes

Sift together the almond powder, the flour, and 60 g of sugar.

Beat the egg whites until stiff. When they start to set, stir in the
rest of the sugar.

Pour the sifted mixture over the egg whites. Mix directly. Arrange on a
sheet of baking paper in a circle.

Bake for about 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 220 ¬∞C.

### Pranin√© feuillet√©

Melt the white chocolate in a double boiler. Add the praline paste.
Homogenize.

Off the heat, add the feuilletine and mix directly.

Pour this mixture over the cooked and cooled almond cake. Smooth the
surface with a spatula.

### Chocolate mousse

Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler.

Separately, bring the cream to a boil. Add the cream to the melted
chocolate, homogenize.

In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture turns white.

Add the soft butter without stopping whipping. Incorporate the
chocolate and cream mixture. Homogenize.

Beat the egg whites until stiff. Incorporate the whites into the
chocolate preparation.

Pour the mousse in the circle over the praline mixture. Make it smooth.

### Finish

Place the Royal in the fridge for about 10 hours.

When ready to serve, sprinkle cocoa through the sieve over the top of
the cake.

## Notes

This cake is fucking rich so you don't want to eat a lot in the same
sitting (and I usually like to eat a lot in the same sitting). It's so
rich the cake cost me literally $50 of ingredients, so that's something
to expect as well.

Do wait the 10 hours like instructed at the end of the recipe. I know,
it's hard. Wait. Fucking wait. Like for tiramisu, there's a reason this
is there, and it makes a hell of a difference, so don't try and skip
that you impatient thing! You'll be disappointed otherwise.

I mean no, you won't be that disappointed, it'll be tasty but it'll be
all soft and mushy and not that cold and you're just going to fuck up
the cake trying to cut it. It's going to break apart and you'll have a
poor sad looking cake at the end.

Still tasty though, I'll grant that to you, but it's not gonna hold
together properly and the taste and texture is even nicer after chilling
for 10 hours, trust me.
