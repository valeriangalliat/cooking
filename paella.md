## Preparation

Mix saffron to the chicken broth.

Cook the onion, bell pepper, and garlic in an oiled pan until onion is
translucent. Add tomatoes, bay leaf, paprika, salt and pepper. Cook for
5 minutes, then add white wine and cook for another 10 minutes.

Add chicken, parsley and rice to the pot, cook for 1 minute.

Add the chorizo and the saffron broth.

Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium low.

Don't stir the rice if you want a crispy crust at the bottom!

Cook uncovered for 15 to 18 minutes.

Add the shrimps, mussels, calamari. Also add peas on top but do not stir
them in. Cook for about 5 more minutes.

If the rice is still not tender, add more broth and continue cooking.

Remove pan from heat, add a lid, and let it rest for 10 minutes.

Garnish with parsley and lemon.
