# 👨‍🍳 Cooking

> 📝 Cooking notes.

Recipes I've tried and/or adapted or even "created", written in good
Frenglish with some tips or notes about quantities and other logistic
details.

Doesn't need to be public, but hey, if that prevents me to make sure I'm
logged on GitHub when I'm at the cheese shop and want to check how much
meules of cheese I need to get for my raclette for 8 people on the
terrasse, that already makes it worthwhile.
