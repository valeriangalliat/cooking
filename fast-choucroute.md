# ü•¨ Fast choucroute

## Recipe

Unlike the traditional choucroute that can take a while to make, this
one is optimized to be fast and simple, yet very tasty.

Based on ["choucroute √† l'alsacienne" on Marmiton][marmiton].

## Ingredients

For 4 people.

* 350 g lardons fum√©s
* Some bay leaves
* 1 onion
* 1 kg choucroute
* 2 garlic cloves
* 10 grains de geni√®vre
* 250 ml riesling
* 350 g potatoes
* 4 sausages

## Preparation

Chop potatoes, cut them in squares, and boil them.

Cook the sausages on the grill or in the oven in parallel.

Add the choucroute and lardons to a pot and start cooking.

Add the garlic, geni√®vre, bay leaves and onion to the choucroute.

Then add the wine and let it on low heat with a lid.

Remove the lid at some point so that water eventually evaporates and
it's not too soggy. Also when the potatoes are tender, add them to the
mix.

Add the sausages on top at the end.

## Extra

If baked the sausages in the oven, make a sauce by adding some cream to
the juices!

Also there's probably an opportunity to put the lardons before anything
else on high eat, get them a bit crispy, then keep proceeding, for a bit
of extra taste and texture.
