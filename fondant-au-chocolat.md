## Ingredients

* 200 g baking chocolate
* 50 g flour
* 100 g sugar
* 100 g butter
* 5 eggs

## Preparation

Preheat 180 °C.

To minimize dishes, melt chocolate and butter together in a pot big
enough to contain everything else.

Separate eggs. If you don't want to wash too much dishes you can just
put the yolks directly in the pot with the butter and chocolate.

Monter les blancs en neige.

Add egg yolks to the melted chocolate and butter (if you didn't do it
already) and mix.

Incorporate sugar and flour, then gently add the "snow" egg whites.

Put in a cake pan and in the oven for 20 minutes.

## Ultra lazy version (not fondant but still chocolat)

To minimize dishes, melt chocolate and butter together in a pot big
enough to contain everything else.

Once melted, add the sugar, flour and eggs and mix everything.

Bake for 20 minutes at 180 °C.

## Canada notes

If using Baker's chocolate, take the semi-sweet (red) one. If using the
unsweetened (blue) one, may want to add a bit more sugar, or could
experiment with adding honey or maple syrup!

## Ramekin version

One day I didn't have enough eggs to make the whole cake, and ChatGPT
told me I could just use half the ingredients and bake it in ramekins
instead. Was dope.

Actually ChatGPT didn't half the sugar and butter so maybe that's why it
was so good? 😂
