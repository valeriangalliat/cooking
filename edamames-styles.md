# ðŸ«› Edamame stylÃ©s

Not a big fan of edamame usually but finally found a way to cook them
where I'm actually loving it so much I would even get more.

## Preparation

Heat a pan with oil.

Add the edamame (add frozen if frozen).

Add seasoning. In my case I went with cumin, ground ginger, dried
cilantro, garlic powder, paprika and chili powder. Also a bit of salt
and pepper.

Grill a bit on high heat, then reduce to medium/low and cover for a long
time (like half an hour).

Near the end add a drizzle of maple syrup and mix well.
