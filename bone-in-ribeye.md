## Preparation

Salt the steak thoroughly.

Season with some steak spice mix and herbes de Provence.

Rest for 10 minutes (the steak, but you can rest as well).

Sear 5 minutes on each side (or until it looks seared enough), then move
the steak to a less intensely hot part of the grill to cook it until
140 Â°F (or until it's done to your taste).

Massage the steak with a noix de beurre while it rests for at least
another 10 minutes.

The rest before and after is important.
