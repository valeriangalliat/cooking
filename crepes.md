# 🥞 Crêpes

## Recipe

Based on [Marmiton's pâte à crêpes simple][marmiton] recipe.

[marmiton]: https://www.marmiton.org/recettes/recette_pate-a-crepes-simple_27121.aspx

## Ingredients

According to Marmiton, for 20 crêpes.

* 5 eggs
* 500 g flour (4 cups)
* 1 L milk
* 3 tbsp oil
* 125 ml beer

## Preparation

To avoid lumps, first beat the eggs alone in the bowl, then add half the
flour and half the milk and mix together, then add the other halves and
mix again.

## Toppings

It's delicious with an egg inside, ham, cheese and onions. The taste is
really close to a tartiflette which is amazing, so I'll call this kind
of crêpe a tarticrêpe.

First, you need to slice and cook the onions beforehand.

Then, don't cook too much the first side of the crêpe, and after the
first flip, add an egg on top and cover the pan. When the egg starts to
cook, add the ham, onion slices and a lot of cheese, and keep the pan
covered until it's done.

For the quantities, you need 1 egg, 1 slice of ham and about 50 g of
grated cheese per tarticrêpe. An onion was good for 6 tarticrêpes.

## Notes

This recipe makes indeed about 20 crêpes. Depending on the crêpes
toppings, the number of people this can feed varies.

For the record, 2 tarticrêpes, one crêpe with just cheese, and one sweet
crêpe after was good for me.

If it had been only cheese and sweet crêpes, I would likely have needed
6 to 8 crêpes.

This quantity for 20 crêpes was largely enough for 4 (there's a fair
amount of leftover dough), so it feeds more like 6 people, provided we
do 2 tarticrêpes each. If we didn't have that much toppings and stuck to
just cheese and sweet crêpes, 20 crêpes would probably have been just
enough for 3.

Here a 400 g block of cheddar was perfect for 3 persons, with 2
tarticrêpes each, but we really went hardcore on cheese and being more
reasonable this would have worked for 4 as well.
